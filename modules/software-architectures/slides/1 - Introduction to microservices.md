# Introduction to Microservices

## Monolithic Architecture

### Benefits of Monolithic Architecture
When applications are relatively small, a monolithic architecture offers numerous advantages:

* **Simplicity in Development**: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and developer tools are optimized for building a single application.
* **Ease of Radical Changes**: Developers can change the code and database schema, then build and deploy the application seamlessly.
* **Straightforward Testing**: End-to-end tests can be written to launch the application, invoke the REST API, and test the UI with tools like Selenium.
* **Simple Deployment**: Developers simply copy the WAR file to a server with Tomcat installed for deployment.

### Challenges of Monolithic Architecture
As successful applications grow, they often outgrow the monolithic architecture, leading to various challenges:

* **Slow Development**: The lengthy build process and slow startup times hinder productivity, making the edit-build-run-test cycle inefficient.
* **Obsolete Technology Stack**: The monolithic structure hampers the adoption of new frameworks and languages, as rewriting the entire application is costly and risky.
* **Testing Challenges**: The large size of the application makes thorough testing difficult, allowing bugs to slip into production.
* **Long Deployment Path**: Updating production becomes cumbersome, often limiting updates to once a month and making continuous deployment nearly impossible.
* **Difficult Scaling**: Conflicting resource requirements among application modules complicate server configuration.

### Scaling a monolithic architecture

**X-axis Scaling**: Involves running multiple instances of the monolithic application behind a load balancer to handle increased load.

However, in most cases, just a few parts of the application are the choke points that require scaling, while other components are used less. 

For example, in a typical e-commerce application, you likely need to scale the product information subsystem, because many more customers browse products than purchase them. More customers use their basket than use the payment pipeline. Fewer customers add comments or view their purchase history. And you might have only a handful of employees that need to manage the content and marketing campaigns. 

**If you scale the monolithic design, all the code for these different tasks is deployed multiple times and scaled at the same grade.**

**Z-axis Scaling**: Each instance is responsible for only a subset of the data, allowing for more efficient resource usage (e.g., routing requests by userId).

However, Scaling a monolithic application by **data sharding** can help manage large datasets, but it has several downsides:

**Complex Data Management**: Sharding requires routing queries to the correct shard, complicates joins across shards, and makes consistency harder to enforce, particularly for transactions and foreign key relationships.

**Limited Scalability**: Sharding only scales the database layer, leaving other layers (like business logic) unoptimized. This can lead to bottlenecks in the application, and inter-shard queries may add latency.

**Operational Overhead**: Sharded databases require extra maintenance, like rebalancing or splitting shards over time. This is complex in a monolithic app where schema changes affect many areas simultaneously.

**Y-axis Scaling**: Introduces functional decomposition, where each service is a mini-application implementing focused functionality.

## Microservice Architecture

As the name implies, a microservices architecture is an approach to building a server application as a set of small services. That means a microservices architecture is mainly oriented to the back-end, although the approach is also being used for the front end. 

* Each microservice runs in its own process and communicates with other processes using protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, or AMQP.
* Each microservice implements a specific end-to-end domain or business capability within a certain
context boundary, and each must be developed autonomously and be deployable independently. 
* Each microservice should own its related domain data model and domain logic (sovereignty
and decentralized data management) and could be based on different data storage technologies
(SQL, NoSQL) and different programming languages.

Why a microservices architecture? 

* **It provides long-term agility**. Microservices enable better maintainability in complex, large, and highly-scalable systems by letting you create applications based on many independently deployable services that each have granular and autonomous lifecycles. 
  * **Maintainability**: Smaller services are easier to maintain and update.
  * **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently, minimizing downtime.
  * **Team Autonomy**: Teams can operate independently, fostering innovation.
  * **Adoption of New Technologies**: Easier to experiment with and integrate new technologies.
  * **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one service "do not" impact others.
* **Microservices can scale out independently**. Instead of having a single monolithic application that you must scale out as a unit, you can instead scale out specific microservices. That way, you can scale just the functional area that needs more processing power or network bandwidth to support demand, rather than scaling out other areas of the application that donâ€™t need to be scaled. That means cost savings because you need less hardware.

## Challenges
While microservice architecture offers flexibility, scalability, and resilience, it introduces several key challenges, especially as systems grow in size and complexity. Here are some of the primary difficulties:

### Dependency on Containerization and Orchestration

Microservices rely on containerization for isolated and consistent environments, but this dependency creates challenges:

- **Container Management:** Each service needs container images, which require careful building, versioning, and storage management.
- **Orchestration Complexity:** Platforms like Kubernetes are essential for managing containerized services at scale, but they introduce complexity in deployment, scaling, resource allocation, and monitoring.
- **Resource and Network Optimization:** Fine-tuning container resource limits and managing secure inter-service networking are critical but complicated tasks.
- **Security Concerns:** Containers add potential attack surfaces, requiring ongoing vulnerability management for each image.

Containerization enables microservices but adds layers of operational and security complexity that require specialized skills.

### Complex Communication Patterns

Microservices communicate over the network, which introduces latency, potential failures, and complexities not present in local function calls:

- **Latency and Fault Tolerance:** Services need to be designed to handle network-related delays and errors gracefully, using techniques like retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, and load balancing.
- **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication:** Choosing between REST, gRPC, or messaging systems like Kafka and RabbitMQ affects latency, coupling, and complexity.
- **Data Serialization:** Serialization protocols (JSON, Protobuf) need to be carefully chosen for efficiency, interoperability, and backward compatibility.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

Microservices introduce shared concerns that each service must address:

- **Resilience and Fault Tolerance:** Each service must implement mechanisms for fault tolerance, retry logic, and graceful degradation, increasing development effort.
- **Caching and Session Management:** Statelessness is generally favored, but handling cache consistency and user session management across services adds complexity.
- **Global Configuration Management:** Managing configurations across services (e.g., using Spring Cloud Config or Consul) requires secure and centralized configuration management.

### Distributed Tracing and Observability

Monitoring the health and performance of many services is a challenge:

- **Centralized Logging:** Logs need to be centralized, parsed, and correlated across services (using tools like ELK stack or Splunk) to provide a unified view.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Tracking requests across services requires specialized tracing tools (e.g., Zipkin, Jaeger) to understand request flow, latency issues, and dependencies.
- **Metric Collection and Alerting:** Each service should emit metrics (e.g., latency, error rates) that can be collected, visualized, and used for alerting.

### Data Consistency and Management

Unlike monolithic architectures, where a single database can enforce data consistency, microservices often have separate databases:

- **Distributed Data Management:** Each microservice might own its data store, which can result in duplicated data and inconsistencies.
- **Eventual Consistency Challenges:** Achieving real-time consistency across services is difficult, and event-based consistency models require design strategies like the **Saga pattern** or **CQRS**.
- **Data Partitioning:** As each service manages its own database, data partitioning becomes complex, especially when different services need access to overlapping datasets.

### Security and Authentication

With multiple services interacting over networks, security becomes paramount:

- **Service Authentication and Authorization:** Ensuring that only authorized services can interact with each other requires protocols like OAuth2, JWT, or mutual TLS.
- **Data Protection:** Enforcing data encryption, both in transit and at rest, as well as managing keys and certificates across services.
- **Attack Surface Management:** With each service exposed over the network, the system's attack surface increases, requiring monitoring and access controls to limit vulnerabilities.


## Microservices Architecture Language Pattern

The [Microservices Architecture Language Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/) is a structured framework that provides a common vocabulary for designing and implementing microservices, addressing the challenges of distributed systems. Aligned with the principles of the [12-Factor App](https://12factor.net/), it emphasizes modularity, scalability, and the separation of concerns. The pattern offers solutions for service decomposition, communication, data management, and resiliency, ensuring that services remain loosely coupled but highly cohesive. By incorporating principles like configuration management, dependency isolation, and statelessness, the language pattern helps ensure that microservices are resilient, easy to scale, and maintainable, supporting cloud-native and continuously deployed applications.
